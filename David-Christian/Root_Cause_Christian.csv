"HIT01_08","The root cause for the thrown exception is in line 279. Within the if statement the program checks is the value of the variable ""minutesOffset"" is less than zero or greater than 59. The documentation states, that the value of the variable can also be negative in some cases. In a case with a negative ""minutesOffset"" value, the program throws the relevant exception."
"HIT02_24","The root cause for the thrown exception is in line 119. The function ""Color"" does not accept negative numbers as input values, but a negative number can be passed to the function. Therefore, the IllegalArgumentException occurs."
"HIT03_6","The root cause for the thrown exception is in the while loop between lines 84 and 97. In line 87 the invocation ""Character.codePointAt"" gets the variable ""pos"" as input. The ""pos"" variable gets incremented in the while loop twice (in line 89 and 95) constantly. Therefore, it could get incremented beyond the ""len"" variable. In that case, the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs."
"HIT04_7","The root cause for the thrown exception is in line 299 and 301. Between lines 298 and 310, calculations are conducted based on a ""maxMiddleIndex"" value greater than 1. The variables ""s"" and ""e"" are initialized based on ""minMiddleIndex"" instead of ""maxMiddleIndex"". Therefore, the AssertionFailedError occurs."
"HIT05_35","The root cause for the thrown error is in line 3288. A new array is initiated as an array of Objects. When an array is passed as null, the implicit casting from Object to String fails. Therefore, the ClassCastException occurs."
"HIT06_51","The root cause for the thrown exception is in line 260. The program casts a Long value to String. The value passed to the Long can have a decimal place which gets eliminated due to the number format. Therefore a different value than expected is cast to String and the ComparisonFailure occurs."
"HIT07_33","The root cause for the thrown exception is in line 910. The program calls ""getClass"" on arrays without checking, if they are null. If ""getClass"" gets called on a null array, the NullPointerException occurs."
"HIT08_54","The root cause for the thrown error is in line 115. The program checks, if the third character of the locale is < ""A"" or > ""Z"" and throws an error in this case. Based on the test, a locale with an underscore at the third position is possible. In ASCII an underscore has a value greater than ""Z"". Therefore the IllegalArgumentException occurs. "
