The problem is at line 279 in the static method ""forOffsetHoursMinutes"" where on line 279 the code reads ""if (minutesOffset < 0 || minutesOffset > 59)"" where minutesOffset < 0 so an IllegalArgumentException is thrown because part of the old code from version 2.3 is still there, whereas line 279 should be ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)"". Line 294 is not where the exception is thrown because the code never reaches that point. The code never reaches the method ""forOffsetHours(int hoursOffset)"" so it never reaches ""forOffsetMillis(int millisOffset)"" either, which means the exception under this method is never reached either because the exception was thrown earlier in the method ""forOffsetHoursMinutes(...)"".

1,48,HIT01_8,VARIABLE_DECLARATION,"Is there any issue with the use or the definition of variable ""minutesOffset"" in the source code below that might be related to the failure?","YES. The issue is on line 279 (as I explained in my first question, of which I misunderstood that I was only being asked about the specific issue, not generalized issue). On line 279 the variable ""minutesOffSet"" is parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0 or > 59. Line 279 should read ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {"" because now the method can take in the number of minutes as a negative and will allow the method to properly progress to invoke/call further methods such as those asked about in the two previous questions.","A,B, E",3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,

My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input, and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true.  I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error.",C,1.0,,,1.0,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,

Anyway, the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.","A, B, C, D",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,4.0,3.0,

Lines 107 to 126 are validating this with if statements. If the str variable does not meet this criteria, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The str varible with a value of fr__POSIX seems to be valid up until line 121 where the if statement checks to see if the 6th character in str in an underscore. Since it is not, an IllegalArgumentException error is thrown with the message Invalid locale format:fr__POSIX","A, C",2.0,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,
